My Second C# Program.  Searches for and downloads the first 25 images, related to a user input, from flickr.

Uses a combination of webscraping using HTML Agility Pack and built in C# libaries to download and save the files.

Note - this might not work on Linux/Mac as it's using Windows style file paths. I think there is only one thing that needs changing (on line 115) to make work with those operating systems
